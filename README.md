Example natural language processing tools for my course 
Statistical Natural Language Processing at Baruch College.

## What's inside
Alogrithms include an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs
and sample code for detecting similarities using
a simple cosine similarity using TF-IDF matrix.

## Usage
Source each file in the `R` directly individually.
Eventually, I'll turn this into a proper package.
